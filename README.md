has a button to uppload prompt from the clipboard and a feature to change the gradio theme of the app (currently set to ocean)

I tested the regular image generation, variation and upscale, image prompt and inpaint successfully with Gradio 5.29

Other features have so far not been tested (mainly because I tend personally to fooocus on the above :-) )

I am looking for a nice logo ... what about this one?

notice the 3 "O" and the magnifying glass symbolising Focus ... I thought it was clever anyway!
