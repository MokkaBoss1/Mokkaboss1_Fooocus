has a button to uppload prompt from the clipboard and a feature to change the gradio theme of the app (currently set to ocean)

I tested the regular image generation, variation and upscale, image prompt and inpaint successfully with Gradio 5.29

Other features have so far not been tested (mainly because I tend personally to fooocus on the above :-) )

the additional features can be controlled in the Extras tab (renamed Audio)

this supports the trigger of an image generation and prompt generator interface in separate browser tabs
